# UI/UX and Accessibility Design

This document outlines the design principles for the "Code Accessibility AI" application, focusing on creating a clean, intuitive, and accessible user experience.

## UI/UX Principles

*   **Clean and Minimalist:** The UI should be uncluttered and easy to navigate, with a focus on the core features.
*   **High Contrast:** Use a high-contrast color scheme to ensure readability for users with low vision.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements should be accessible and operable via the keyboard.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application should be usable on a variety of screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## Accessibility Features

*   **ARIA Compliance:** All components will be ARIA-compliant, with appropriate roles, states, and properties.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** The application will be tested with screen readers to ensure a seamless experience for visually impaired users.
*   **Focus Management:** The application will manage focus appropriately, ensuring that keyboard users can easily navigate the UI.
*   **Accessible Forms:** All forms will have clear labels and instructions, and will be accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.

## Color Palette

*   **Primary:** `#007bff` (a vibrant, accessible blue)
*   **Secondary:** `#6c757d` (a neutral gray)
*   **Text:** `#212529` (a dark, readable black)
*   **Background:** `#ffffff` (a clean, high-contrast white)

## Typography

*   **Font:** A sans-serif font like Arial or Helvetica will be used for maximum readability.
*   **Font Size:** The base font size will be 16px, with larger sizes used for headings and other important text.

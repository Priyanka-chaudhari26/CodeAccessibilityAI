## ✨ Contribution Guidelines
Even though this is a hackathon project, contributions and feedback are welcome:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
```

3. Create a new branch and implement changes.
```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
4. Add, commit, and push changes.
   
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin <branch-name>

- Submodules are used for the backend:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
